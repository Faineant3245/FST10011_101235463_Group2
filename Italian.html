     <p>Italian dishes are usually very simple with very little ingredients,
      so they are reliant on both the quality of ingredients and the skill
      of the cook who made it. </p>
  	 <p>However, Italian dishes can still be good even without top notch
      ingredients and can be cheap to make, making it ideal for homecooks
      to practice and try out the cuisine.</p><br>
     <h2>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio</h1><br>
       <div class="foodpic"><img src="images/Aglio_e_olio.jpg" alt=""></div><br>
	   <p>Name literally meaning spaghetti with garlic and oil, this classic
       pasta dish is really easy to make at home with just the mentioned
       ingredients. Just by boiling the spaghetti, toasting the sliced
       garlic and some red pepper flakes in olive oil and transfering
       the pasta and some of its boiling water to the pan that is used to toast
       the garlic, you have an extremely delicious pasta dish in just about
       10-20 minutes and you can totally add anything you'd like in it such
       as the traditional parsley and red pepper flakes.</p><br>
     <h2>Spaghetti Carbonara</h1><br>
       <div class="foodpic"><img src="images/spaghetti-carbonara.jpg" alt=""></div><br>
	   <p>Although simple at its core with simple ingredients, this pasta dish
       can be tricky to get right. The egg mixture that is used for the sauce
       could curdle in a flash when not handled well. However, the payoff for
       mastering this dish is amazing as you have easy access to a rich,
       creamy and flavorful pasta dish in about 10-20 minutes</p><br>
	   <h2>Gnocchi</h1><br>
       <div class="foodpic"><img src="images/gnocchi.jpg" alt=""></div><br>
	   <p>This simple dumpling made commonly with a mix of potato and
       flour can be the carrier of any sauce and be absolutely
       lip-smacking.</p><br><br>
